# **Dart2.0**

## **Project Description**

  A school project I worked on for one of my assignments. Was supposed to be able to add players by name, have them throw "darts" by using random range,
  and then subtracting it from a total, storing the number for each round. This was however before we learned nested classes and inheritence so I wasn't able
  to do this.
